this project is to analyse the eye movements data of healthy adults reading short texts.
There are 40 variables in this data set, including perspective, condition and various eye movement measures.
The readers had different goals (condition), to the perspective veriable should correlate with condition variable. 
I am interested to see what eye movement measures correlate with reading perspective and condition, especially if first fixation duration, average fixation duration, gaze duration, number of first pass fixations, and number of regressions correlat ewith each other and are good predictors of a reading goal.
