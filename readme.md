This project was created for 611 class, fall 2024. The data set I am using is an
eye tracking data from 45 healthy adults. During the data collection 
participants read 6 short texts twice from a given perspective (of a real 
estate buyer or a baby sitter), then switched their perspective and read the 
texts again. The data set consists of 39 variables and 76517 observations. 
My goal is to see the patterns in the data which will help us understand the 
mechanisms of text processing better. Namely I am interested to look into eye 
tracking processing data which might predict attention allocation during text 
rereading.
